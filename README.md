# Welcome

This Github Repository contains the source code that is used for the Mission Visualization Toolkit (MVT), an executable that simplifies visualization for the Space Communications and Navigations (SCaN) network in 3D space. This project was developed as a part of a NASA internship opportunity. 

# About Us

Hello! We are a team of five high schoolers who were brought together by NASA and spent our summer working on this visualization.
Our names are Aman Garg (Gilman School, class of 2024), Arya Kazemnia (Gilman School, class of 2024), Leo Wang (Gilman School, class of 2024), Vicki Carrica (Old Saybrook High School, class of 2023), and Zoe Schoeneman-Frye (Montgomery Blair High School, class of 2022). Aman, Arya, and Leo are participating in an Experiential Learning Opportunity (ELO) this summer due to not meeting the age requirements to be official NASA interns, while Vicki and Zoe are both participating in their first internships at NASA. 

## Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding this project, feel free to connect with Vicki Carrica at vickicarrica@yahoo.com and she can put you in contact with whoever is most likely to be able to help you. 

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Unity should be installed on your device before opening the project.
* This project currently works under version 2020.3.8f1 of Unity.
* WebGL Build Support should be installed as a platform.
 - To do this, go to Installs in Unity Hub.
 - Under the 2020.3.8f1 version, click Add Modules.
 - Find WebGL and install.
* Github Desktop should be installed on your device

## Adding The Project To Unity

This project was built on Unity. To be able to see it on that platform, perform the following steps:
* Begin by downloading all the project files to your computer. 
* Open the Unity Hub app.
* Select the "ADD" button under the projects tab.
* Select the corresponding project file on your computer.
* Make sure that the current Target Platform is WebGL and that the Unity Version is 2020.3.8f1.
* Open the project once added.

# Usage

MVT is built to extend the capabilities of STK and replace it in some capacity. It will allow SCaN systems to be visualized in an interactive space, one in which the perspective of the viewer could explore the 3D visualization with time manipulation as opposed to the video-like experience generated from STK. The operational cost of MVT is quite low, almost negligible, and it operates in real-time. To display STK in a browser is a time intensive and difficult task where MVT is less convoluted to make it more accessible to not only NASA employees but also NASA customers.

To begin with MVT, click the start button to navigate out of the home screen. Under the navigation tab, select a planet or satellite to follow and one as the reference frame. Change the slider above the start button to 120 and click play to begin the visualization. Further details on its usage will be included later.

# Contributions

We welcome contributions and additions! To make a change you must:
* Fork the repository.
* Make the change on Unity
* Build the project using WebGL. Select the folder ProjectName > Builds and add a new build number.
* Open Github Desktop and open the repository.
* Commit and push your changes onto Github
* To open a website of the changed project:
 - Go to settings in your repository
 - Go to Pages within Settings

 Please be conscious of crediting our work when changes are made.
 
# Acknowledgements
 
We'd like to begin by thanking NASA as a whole for the opportunity to intern this summer. The Goddard Space Flight center did a particularly good job of making our internships meaningful and exciting experiences. The Space Communications and Navigations (SCaN) team were incredibly welcoming and kind to us and aided us immensely during our project.
 
We cannot thank our mentor, George D. Bussey, enough for all of his help during this summer. He went above and beyond to provide an educational and worthwhile project. We would also like to thank our co-mentor, Elana Resnick, for helping those who attend Gilman school be a part of this project.

Finally, we would like to thank Jimmy Acevedo and Korine Powers for their role in making this summer so enjoyable.
